TO DO:
1. Add some more visualisations. E.g. a bar chart showing how much extra information is gained by adding more variables (for the PCA analysis). Elena Mocanu mentioned that visualisations are likely to improve the grade.
2. Add more to results section about e.g F1 score.
3. Nicer formatting + captions.
